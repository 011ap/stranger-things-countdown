## ðŸ”¦ Into the Upside Down

This project is a **Stranger Things Season 5 finale countdown**â€”a real-time ticker that captures the tension, nostalgia, and mystery of Hawkins' last ride. 

Built with passion for the show. Styled with retro neon. Designed to feel like stepping into 1986... or maybe something darker.

**Features:**
- â±ï¸ **Live countdown timer** â€“ Days, hours, minutes, seconds to the finale
- ðŸŽ¨ **Neon aesthetic** â€“ Pure black background + Netflix red branding
- ðŸ–±ï¸ **Interactive streaming button** â€“ Direct link to watch on Netflix
- ðŸ“± **Responsive design** â€“ Works on desktop, tablet, mobile
- ðŸŒ™ **Dark mode native** â€“ Hawkins vibes 24/7

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
stranger-things-countdown/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main countdown interface
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css           # Neon styling (embedded)

```

**Single-file design** â€“ Everything bundled in `index.html` for simplicity and speed.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Countdown Timer** â€“ Calculates days/hours/minutes/seconds until the Stranger Things finale date
2. **Live Updates** â€“ Timer refreshes every second with smooth animations
3. **Netflix Integration** â€“ Click the button to stream directly to Netflix
4. **Responsive Layout** â€“ Adapts to any screen size

The countdown displays:
```
ðŸ• DAYS | HOURS | MINUTES | SECONDS
```

Styled in bold, neon red, with that authentic Netflix/Stranger Things cinematic feel.

## ðŸŽ¬ Customization

--background: #000000;     /* Deep Black */
